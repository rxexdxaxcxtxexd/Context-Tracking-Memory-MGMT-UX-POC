## Daily Usage (After Setup)

Once configured, generating reports is easy:

**Windows:** Double-click `RUN_REPORT.bat`
**Mac/Linux:** Run `./run_report.sh`

The tool remembers your settings, so you only need to confirm the sprint number.

---

## What Your Report Includes

✅ All Jira tickets in the sprint
✅ Team completion statistics
✅ Epic progress breakdown
✅ Meeting summaries (AI-powered)
✅ Identified blockers
✅ Team velocity trends

Reports are saved as `.md` files in your Downloads folder.

**Viewing reports:**
- Open with Notepad/TextEdit
- Open with VS Code (prettier formatting)
- Convert to PDF with https://dillinger.io/

## If Something Goes Wrong

### "Python not found"
- Reinstall Python from python.org
- ✅ Make sure you check "Add Python to PATH"

### "Authentication failed"
- Your Jira or Fathom credentials might be wrong
- Run setup again: double-click `SETUP.bat`

### "No meetings found"
- Try a simpler keyword like "Sprint" instead of specific team names
- Check that Fathom has meetings recorded

### "Credits exhausted"
The tool will show you two options:
1. Contact Layden for more credits
2. Add your own Claude key (~$1-2 per report)

**Don't worry** - the tool still works without AI, you just won't get meeting summaries.
